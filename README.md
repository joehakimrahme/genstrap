GENSTRAP
========

A small utility turns a markdown file into a beautiful html page thanks to [strapdown.js](http://strapdownjs.com/). It's mainly for me an excuse to learn and practice the Go language.

How it works
------------

	$ genstrap --help
    Usage of genstrap:
      -filename="etc/sample.md": The name of the input file.
      -theme="cerulean": The Boostrap theme.
      -title="Generated with genstrap": The HTML title of the generated page.
